# Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
My name is JoÃ£o Pedro Viana Freitas.

I'm a full .Net developer	:smiley: , with experience in several other areas: linux, docker, unity... I develop mods/plugins for unity games and various other applications, i am dedicated and interested in learning anything, so my knowledge is vast and I intend to deepen it. I am looking for offers to work or contribute in projects of any size, aiming to learn, develop and achieve any goal.

Since I was a kid I am fascinated by the idea of being able to create something from scratch and evolve it, the idea is simple, as all IDEs call it, a solution, they say you can't do anything perfect, but programming is solving problem after problem until there is none, or almost none. 
Create, Evolve and Learn are always my goals.

I wish to enter the computer science course at UNICAMP. :wink:
